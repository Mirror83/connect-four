# Connect Four

This repository consists two differrent implementations of Connect Four, one in
JavaScript and the other in Python.

Both were implemented following tutorials from freeCodeCamp.
// To insert links to the tutorials

The JavaScript implementation is slightly different from the one in the video by
Ania Kubow in how one checks for a win. In her imiplementation, she uses an array that is hard-coded
with all the possible winning locations

in the implementation here, however, a win is checked by checking if the is a matching row of four
same-colored pieces surrounding the last placed piece
